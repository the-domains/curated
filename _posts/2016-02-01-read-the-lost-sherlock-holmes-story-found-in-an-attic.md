description: 'I was dismissed and had to find copy by hook or by crook. Well, the Faculty of Imagination might be worth a trial. The familiar house in Sloan Street met my bewildered gaze. The door was shut, the blinds drawn. I entered; doors are no barrier to one who uses the Faculty of Imagination.'
